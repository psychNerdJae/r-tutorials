# R Tutorials
 
Miscellaneous teaching materials I've developed for people who are new to using R. Not intended to be comprehensive. Utterly lacking in organization for now.

**Useful resources:**
1. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
	- Oriented around data science workflows, and less around statistics
	- Extremely accessible to people who know nothing about programming
	- Makes extensive use of the tidyverse, which is a collection of R packages that streamlines the process of cleaning/analyzing data
	- Written by one of the lead programmers of many tidyverse packages
2. [Learning Statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/)
	- Oriented around statistics
	- Extremely accessible to people who know very little about statistics or programming
	- Teaches statistics from first principles, and focuses on conceptual underpinnings
	- Written by a psychologist whose speciality is in computational modeling
3. [Deep dive into statistics using R](http://users.stat.umn.edu/~helwig/teaching.html)
	- A wealth of resources for people who want more statistical grounding and translations of mathematical formalisms into R code
	- Covers everything from simple linear regression to multivariate/nonparametric statistics
	- Great resource for brushing up on advanced statistical concepts
4. [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)
	- For people who are specifically interested in doing a deep-dive into R *as a programming language*
	- Not really necessary for the average user, but may be a good resource if you're getting a weird error message and want to figure out exactly what it means
